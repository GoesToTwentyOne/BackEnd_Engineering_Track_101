# Virtual Environment Setup Readme

This readme.md file provides instructions for setting up and using a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.

## Step 1: Installing virtualenv

To use a virtual environment, you need to have `virtualenv` installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using `pip`. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Step 2: Test your installation

To verify that `virtualenv` is installed correctly, you can check its version. Run the following command:

```
virtualenv --version
```

If you see the version number displayed, it means the installation was successful.

## Step 3: Naming the virtual environment

Now, it's time to create your virtual environment. You can give it any name you prefer. For this example, we will name it `my_env`. To create the virtual environment, run the following command:

```
virtualenv my_env
```

This will create a new directory named `my_env` that contains the necessary files for your virtual environment.

## Step 4: Activate the virtual environment

To start using your virtual environment, you need to activate it. Activation sets up your shell to use the Python executable and packages from the virtual environment instead of the global system Python. On Windows, the activation script is located in the `Scripts` directory. On macOS and Linux, it is in the `bin` directory.

### On Windows:

```
.\my_env\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux:

```
source ./my_env/bin/activate
```

After activation, you should see the name of your virtual environment appear in your shell prompt.

## Step 5: Deactivate the virtual environment

When you're done working within the virtual environment and want to switch back to the global Python environment, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

Simply run the following command, regardless of your operating system:

```
deactivate
```

This will revert your shell back to using the system's Python installation.

Remember to activate your virtual environment again when you want to resume work on your project.

That's it! You now have a virtual environment set up and can start installing packages and working on your Python projects without interfering with your system-wide Python installation. Happy coding!





# Django Install 
```
  pip install django
  python -m django --version

```
# Django Project 
```
django-admin startproject first_project
python manage.py runserver
django-admin startapp first_app
```


# Structure

In Django, the default project file structure is designed to organize your Django project in a scalable and maintainable manner. When you create a new Django project, the following is the default file structure you'll typically find:

```
my_project/
    ├── manage.py
    ├── my_project/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    └── my_app/
        ├── migrations/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── admin.py
        ├── apps.py
        ├── models.py
        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py
```

Now, let's briefly describe each of the components:

1. `manage.py`: This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project. You can use it to run the development server, create database tables, and perform various other management tasks.

2. `my_project/`: This is the main project directory (also called the project package). The inner `my_project/` directory contains the settings and configurations for your Django project.

   - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
   - `asgi.py`: ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It is used for running Django applications with asynchronous web servers.
   - `settings.py`: This file contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, static files, and more.
   - `urls.py`: This file defines the URL patterns for your project. It maps the URLs to the corresponding views.
   - `wsgi.py`: WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface. It is used for running Django applications with WSGI-compatible web servers.

3. `my_app/`: This is a sample app within the project. You can have multiple apps within a Django project. Each app represents a distinct functionality of the project.

   - `migrations/`: This directory contains database migration files generated by Django when you make changes to your models.
   - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
   - `admin.py`: This file is used to define the admin interface for your app's models.
   - `apps.py`: This file defines the configuration for your app.
   - `models.py`: This is where you define your app's data models using Django's model system.
   - `tests.py`: This is where you can write test cases for your app.
   - `views.py`: This is where you define the views (functions or classes) that handle HTTP requests and return responses.

Apart from these default components, you may also find additional directories and files if you generate a new Django app using `django-admin startapp app_name`. Django is highly customizable, and you can organize your code and add new files as needed to suit the requirements of your project.
