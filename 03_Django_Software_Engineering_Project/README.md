## Introduction to Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a high-level web framework written in Python that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, often referred to as Model-View-Template (MVT) in Django. The framework's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites by emphasizing reusability and "batteries-included" components.

Key features of Django include:

- Object-relational mapping (ORM) for database management
- URL routing and request handling
- Form handling and validation
- Template system for front-end design
- Built-in admin interface
- Security mechanisms
- Scalability and flexibility

Django's simplicity and versatility make it an excellent choice for developing web applications, ranging from small personal projects to large enterprise-level systems.
