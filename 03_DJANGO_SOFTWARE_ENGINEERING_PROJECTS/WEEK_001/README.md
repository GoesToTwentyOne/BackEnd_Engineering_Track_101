## 1.1 Introduction to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies the process of building web applications. Imagine you're setting up a restaurant. Instead of constructing tables and chairs from scratch, Django provides pre-built components like authentication systems and database models. This example illustrates how Django makes web development more efficient and organized.

## 1.2 Python and Vs Code Installation

Before diving into Django, ensure you have the necessary tools. Install Python, the programming language Django is built on, and VS Code, a popular code editor. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
python --version
```
This should display the installed Python version. If Python is not installed, download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Now, install VS Code by downloading and following the instructions from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 1.3 Introduction to Virtual Environment

Imagine you're working on multiple dishes in your kitchen. You wouldn't want the flavors to mix, right? Similarly, in web development, you'll create different projects, and it's essential to keep their dependencies separate. Let's use Python's `venv` module to create virtual environments.

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## 1.4 Django Installation

With your virtual environment active, let's install Django:

```bash
pip install Django
```

This command installs Django within the virtual environment, ensuring that it doesn't interfere with other projects.

## 1.5 Creating a Django Project

Now that Django is installed, let's create a project. Imagine you're starting a new restaurant. Run:

```bash
django-admin startproject myrestaurant
```

This command creates a directory named `myrestaurant` with the basic project structure.

## 1.6 Project Directory Structure

Navigate to the `myrestaurant` directory and explore the structure. Use the following command to see the contents:

- On Windows:
```bash
dir
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
ls
```

You'll see files like `manage.py`, which is a command-line utility, and a folder named after your project.

## 1.7 Working with urls.py and views.py

In your project, open the `urls.py` file within the project folder. This is like your restaurant's menu. You define which URLs lead to which views. For example:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

Now, create a `views.py` file within the project folder. This is where you define the logic for the views. For instance:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to My Restaurant!")
```

## 1.8 Creating an App

Imagine you want to offer a dessert menu in your restaurant. You'd create a dedicated section for desserts, right? In Django, we call these sections "apps." Let's create a dessert app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp desserts
```

This command creates an app named `desserts`. You can now add specific views, models, and templates for your dessert section.

## Conclusion

You've completed Module 1! You've set up your environment, installed Django, created a project, and started working with views and URLs. You're ready to move on to Module 2 and dive deeper into Django's powerful features.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Module 2: Building Dynamic Views with Django to learn how to create interactive web pages and enhance your restaurant's menu further.

# Virtual Environment Setup Readme

This readme.md file provides instructions for setting up and using a virtual environment using `virtualenv`.

## Step 1: Installing virtualenv

To use a virtual environment, you need to have `virtualenv` installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using `pip`. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Step 2: Test your installation

To verify that `virtualenv` is installed correctly, you can check its version. Run the following command:

```
virtualenv --version
```

If you see the version number displayed, it means the installation was successful.

## Step 3: Naming the virtual environment

Now, it's time to create your virtual environment. You can give it any name you prefer. For this example, we will name it `my_env`. To create the virtual environment, run the following command:

```
virtualenv my_env
```

This will create a new directory named `my_env` that contains the necessary files for your virtual environment.

## Step 4: Activate the virtual environment

To start using your virtual environment, you need to activate it. Activation sets up your shell to use the Python executable and packages from the virtual environment instead of the global system Python. On Windows, the activation script is located in the `Scripts` directory. On macOS and Linux, it is in the `bin` directory.

### On Windows:

```
.\my_env\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux:

```
source ./my_env/bin/activate
```

After activation, you should see the name of your virtual environment appear in your shell prompt.

## Step 5: Deactivate the virtual environment

When you're done working within the virtual environment and want to switch back to the global Python environment, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

Simply run the following command, regardless of your operating system:

```
deactivate
```

This will revert your shell back to using the system's Python installation.

Remember to activate your virtual environment again when you want to resume work on your project.

That's it! You now have a virtual environment set up and can start installing packages and working on your Python projects without interfering with your system-wide Python installation. Happy coding!





# Django Install 
```
  pip install django
  python -m django --version

```
# Django Project 
```
django-admin startproject first_project
python manage.py runserver
django-admin startapp first_app
```


# Structure

In Django, the default project file structure is designed to organize your Django project in a scalable and maintainable manner. When you create a new Django project, the following is the default file structure you'll typically find:

```
my_project/
    ├── manage.py
    ├── my_project/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    └── my_app/
        ├── migrations/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── admin.py
        ├── apps.py
        ├── models.py
        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py
```

Now, let's briefly describe each of the components:

1. `manage.py`: This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with your Django project. You can use it to run the development server, create database tables, and perform various other management tasks.

2. `my_project/`: This is the main project directory (also called the project package). The inner `my_project/` directory contains the settings and configurations for your Django project.

   - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
   - `asgi.py`: ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface. It is used for running Django applications with asynchronous web servers.
   - `settings.py`: This file contains all the configuration settings for your Django project, such as database settings, installed apps, middleware, static files, and more.
   - `urls.py`: This file defines the URL patterns for your project. It maps the URLs to the corresponding views.
   - `wsgi.py`: WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface. It is used for running Django applications with WSGI-compatible web servers.

3. `my_app/`: This is a sample app within the project. You can have multiple apps within a Django project. Each app represents a distinct functionality of the project.

   - `migrations/`: This directory contains database migration files generated by Django when you make changes to your models.
   - `__init__.py`: An empty file that marks the directory as a Python package.
   - `admin.py`: This file is used to define the admin interface for your app's models.
   - `apps.py`: This file defines the configuration for your app.
   - `models.py`: This is where you define your app's data models using Django's model system.
   - `tests.py`: This is where you can write test cases for your app.
   - `views.py`: This is where you define the views (functions or classes) that handle HTTP requests and return responses.

Apart from these default components, you may also find additional directories and files if you generate a new Django app using `django-admin startapp app_name`. Django is highly customizable, and you can organize your code and add new files as needed to suit the requirements of your project.
