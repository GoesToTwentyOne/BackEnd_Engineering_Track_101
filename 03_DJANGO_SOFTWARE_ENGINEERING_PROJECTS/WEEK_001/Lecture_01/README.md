## 1.1 What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework designed to simplify the process of building web applications. Think of it like setting up a restaurant: instead of crafting tables and chairs from scratch, Django provides ready-made components, including authentication systems and database models. This analogy showcases how Django streamlines web development, making it more efficient and structured.

## 1.2 Setting Up Python and Visual Studio Code

Before delving into Django, ensure you have the necessary tools. Install Python, the programming language on which Django is built, and Visual Studio Code, a widely-used code editor. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

This command will display the installed Python version. If Python isn't installed, download it from the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, grab Visual Studio Code by downloading and following the instructions on the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 1.3 Understanding Virtual Environments

Imagine working on multiple recipes in your kitchen. You wouldn't want flavors to mix, right? Similarly, in web development, you'll create various projects, and it's crucial to keep their dependencies separate. Python's `venv` module comes to the rescue.

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

## 1.4 Installing Django

With your virtual environment active, let's install Django:

```bash
pip install Django
```

This command installs Django within the virtual environment, preventing interference with other projects.

## 1.5 Creating Your First Django Project

Now that Django is installed, let's create a project. Imagine starting a new restaurant. Run:

```bash
django-admin startproject myrestaurant
```

This command spawns a directory named `myrestaurant` with the fundamental project structure.

## 1.6 Navigating the Project Directory Structure

Navigate to the `myrestaurant` directory and explore the structure. Use these commands to view the contents:

- On Windows:
```bash
dir
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```bash
ls
```

You'll encounter files like `manage.py`, a command-line utility, and a folder named after your project.

## 1.7 Working with URL Patterns and Views

In your project, open the `urls.py` file within the project folder. This functions as your restaurant's menu, mapping URLs to views. For instance:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
]
```

Create a `views.py` file within the project folder. Here, you define the logic for your views. For instance:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to My Restaurant!")
```

## 1.8 Crafting Your First App

Visualize offering a dessert menu in your restaurant. You'd create a dedicated section for desserts, right? In Django, these sections are called "apps." Let's craft a dessert app:

```bash
python manage.py startapp desserts
```

This command births an app named `desserts`. You can now add specific views, models, and templates for your dessert section.

## Conclusion

You've completed Module 1! Your environment is set up, Django is installed, you've initiated a project, and started working with views and URLs. You're now primed for Module 2, delving deeper into Django's powerful capabilities.

## Next Steps

Proceed to Module 2: Building Dynamic Views with Django, where you'll master crafting interactive web pages to further enhance your restaurant's menu.

# Setting Up a Virtual Environment

This readme.md file provides comprehensive instructions for establishing and utilizing a virtual environment through `virtualenv`.

## Step 1: Installing virtualenv

Before diving into virtual environments, ensure you have `virtualenv` installed on your system. If not, execute the following command via your terminal or command prompt:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Step 2: Verifying the Installation

To confirm the successful installation of `virtualenv`, check its version. Issue the following command:

```
virtualenv --version


```

A displayed version number indicates a successful installation.

## Step 3: Creating Your Virtual Environment

The time has come to construct your virtual environment. Name it as desired; for our example, we'll call it `my_env`. To generate the virtual environment, input:

```
virtualenv my_env
```

This action generates a new directory named `my_env`, containing the essential files for your virtual environment.

## Step 4: Activating the Virtual Environment

To begin utilizing your virtual environment, activate it. Activation configures your shell to utilize the Python executable and packages from the virtual environment instead of the system-wide Python. On Windows, the activation script is within the `Scripts` directory. On macOS and Linux, it's found in the `bin` directory.

### On Windows:

```
.\my_env\Scripts\activate
```

### On macOS and Linux:

```
source ./my_env/bin/activate
```

After activation, you'll observe your virtual environment's name in your shell prompt.

## Step 5: Deactivating the Virtual Environment

Upon completing your work within the virtual environment and desiring to revert to the global Python environment, deactivate the virtual environment. Execute the following command, regardless of your operating system:

```
deactivate
```

This action restores your shell to utilize the system's Python installation.

Remember to reactivate your virtual environment when resuming work on your project.

There you have it! Your virtual environment is ready, allowing package installation and project work without affecting the system-wide Python installation. Happy coding!

# Django Installation
```bash
pip install django
python -m django --version
```

# Creating a Django Project
```bash
django-admin startproject first_project
python manage.py runserver
django-admin startapp first_app
```

# Project Directory Structure

Django's default project file structure is designed for scalability and maintainability. Upon creating a new Django project, you'll typically encounter the following default structure:

```
my_project/
    ├── manage.py
    ├── my_project/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    └── my_app/
        ├── migrations/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── admin.py
        ├── apps.py
        ├── models.py
        ├── tests.py
        └── views.py
```

Let's briefly explain each component:

1. `manage.py`: A command-line utility facilitating interaction with your Django project. It's used to run the development server, create database tables, and manage various other tasks.

2. `my_project/`: The main project directory (project package). The inner `my_project/` directory contains settings and configurations for your Django project.

   - `__init__.py`: An empty file denoting the directory as a Python package.
   - `asgi.py`: For running Django applications with asynchronous web servers (ASGI).
   - `settings.py`: Contains configuration settings like database settings, installed apps, middleware, static files, etc.
   - `urls.py`: Defines URL patterns mapping to views.
   - `wsgi.py`: For running Django applications with WSGI-compatible web servers.

3. `my_app/`: A sample app within the project. Multiple apps can exist in a Django project, each representing distinct functionality.

   - `migrations/`: Contains database migration files created when changes are made to models.
   - `__init__.py`: An empty file denoting the directory as a Python package.
   - `admin.py`: Defines the admin interface for the app's models.
   - `apps.py`: Configuration for the app.
   - `models.py`: Defines app's data models using Django's model system.
   - `tests.py`: Where test cases can be written.
   - `views.py`: Defines views (functions or classes) handling HTTP requests and responses.

These are the default components, but you can customize and organize your code further based on your project's needs.
