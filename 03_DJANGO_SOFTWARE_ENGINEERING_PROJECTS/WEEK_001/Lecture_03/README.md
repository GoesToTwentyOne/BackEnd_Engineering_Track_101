Sure, here's an improved version of your `README.md` documentation that explains the configuration and usage of static and media files in a Django project:

# Project Static and Media File Configuration

This README.md document provides an overview of the configuration and usage of static and media files in a Django project.

## Static File Configuration

Static files such as stylesheets, JavaScript files, and images play a crucial role in web applications. Django provides a built-in mechanism to manage and serve static files efficiently.

In your project's settings (`settings.py`), you'll find the following configuration related to static files:

```python
# settings.py

# Define the URL for serving static files
STATIC_URL = 'static/'

# Define the directories where static files are located
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    BASE_DIR / 'core/static/'
]
```

Here's what each setting does:

- `STATIC_URL`: This setting defines the base URL under which your static files will be served. For example, if `STATIC_URL` is set to `'static/'`, your static files will be accessible at URLs like `http://yourdomain.com/static/`.

- `STATICFILES_DIRS`: This list contains the directories where your static files are located. In the provided configuration, the `core/static/` directory within your project's base directory (`BASE_DIR`) is included. You can add more directories if needed.

## Media File Configuration

Media files, which include user-uploaded content such as images or files, require a slightly different setup. Django provides mechanisms to handle these files as well.

In your project's settings (`settings.py`), configure media file settings:

```python
# settings.py

# Define the root directory for media files
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'

# Define the URL for serving media files
MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
```

Here's what each setting does:

- `MEDIA_ROOT`: This setting specifies the local filesystem path where media files will be stored. In the provided configuration, media files will be stored in a directory named `media` within your project's base directory (`BASE_DIR`).

- `MEDIA_URL`: This setting defines the base URL under which your media files will be accessible via the web. For example, if `MEDIA_URL` is set to `'media/'`, your media files will be accessible at URLs like `http://yourdomain.com/media/`.

## URL Configuration

In your project's `urls.py` file, you'll need to configure the URLs that serve your views and templates. The following configuration includes URL patterns for the admin interface, the homepage, and an app named `my_app_practice`:

```python
# urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.urls import path, include
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', views.home),
    path('my_app_practice/', include('my_app_practice.urls')),
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

The `static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)` line is added to ensure that media files are served correctly during development.

## Django Template Language URL Tag

Django's template language provides a convenient way to generate URLs for your static and media files. You can use the `{% static %}` and `{% url %}` template tags to reference these files in your HTML templates.

For static files:

```html
<img src="{% static 'images/logo.png' %}" alt="Logo">
```

For media files:

```html
<img src="{{ object.image.url }}" alt="User Image">

```

Certainly! Here's a well-structured `README.md` documentation that explains the concept of template inheritance in Django:

---

# Template Inheritance in Django

Template inheritance, also known as template extending, is a powerful feature in Django that allows you to create a base "skeleton" template containing common elements of your site and define blocks that child templates can override. This helps in maintaining consistent layouts and structure across multiple pages of your web application.

## How Template Inheritance Works

When using template inheritance, you create a base template that includes the common structure and placeholders for content that can be overridden. The base template contains one or more `{% block %}` tags that define the areas where content can be replaced in the child templates.

### The `extends` Tag

To use template inheritance, you start your child templates with the `{% extends 'parent_template_name' %}` tag. This tells Django which base template to inherit from. You can extend templates from other directories using relative paths.

Example:

```django
{% extends "./base1.html" %}
{% extends "../base2.html" %}
{% extends "./my/base3.html" %}
```

### The `block` Tag

In the base template, you use the `{% block blockname %}...{% endblock %}` tags to define blocks that can be overridden in child templates. The block tags act as placeholders for content.

Example:

```django
{% block title %}{% endblock %}
{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
```

### Using `block.super`

If you need to include the content of the same block from the parent template, you can use the `{{ block.super }}` variable within the child template's block.

Example:

```django
{% block title %}{{ block.super }}Home{% endblock %}
```

## Rules for Template Inheritance

1. The `{% extends %}` tag must be the first template tag in a template.
2. Use multiple `{% block %}` tags in the base templates for better flexibility.
3. Avoid defining multiple blocks with the same name in the same template.
4. If you need to access the content of a block from the parent template, use `{{ block.super }}`.

## Example

Here's an example to illustrate template inheritance:

**base.html**
```django
<html>
<head>
<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
</head>
<body>
{% block content %}{% endblock content %}
</body>
</html>
```

**home.html**
```django
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}
Home
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Home Page</h1>
{% endblock content %}
```

**about.html**
```django
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}
About
{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
<h1>About Page</h1>
{% endblock content %}
```
Sure, let's simplify the documentation while retaining the key points:

# Making Custom Template 

## Introduction

This documentation explains how to use custom template tags in the `templatetags` folder of your Django app to extend template functionality.

## Installation

1. Create a folder named `templatetags` in your Django app's main directory.
2. Add Python files with your custom template tags in this folder.
3. Import required modules from Django's template libraries at the beginning of your Python files.

## Custom Template Filter

A custom template filter lets you modify template variable content. Here's how:

1. Define a Python function to perform the transformation.
2. Register the function using `register.filter`.
3. Use the filter in templates: `{{ variable | filter_name:argument }}`.

Example:
```python
from django import template

register = template.Library()

def my_template(value, args):
    if args == 'change':
        value = "Alex Goot"
        return value
    if args == 'title':
        return value.title()

register.filter('change_name', my_template)
```

Usage in templates:
```html
{{ "hello world" | change_name:"change" }} <!-- Outputs: "Alex Goot" -->
{{ "this is a test" | change_name:"title" }} <!-- Outputs: "This Is A Test" -->
```

## Custom Inclusion Tag

A custom inclusion tag lets you include dynamic content in templates. Here's how:

1. Define a Python function to generate the content as a dictionary.
2. Use `register.inclusion_tag` to associate the function with a template.
3. Include the tag in templates: `{% inclusion_tag_name %}`.

Example:
```python
from django import template
from django.template.loader import get_template

register = template.Library()

def show_courses():
    courses = [
        {'Id': 101, 'course': 'c++', 'Teacher': 'Alex Smith'},
        {'Id': 102, 'course': 'databases', 'Teacher': 'Gorkie'},
        {'Id': 103, 'course': 'django', 'Teacher': 'Bruno'}
    ]
    return {'courses': courses}

courses_template = get_template('my_app/courses.html')
register.inclusion_tag(courses_template)(show_courses)
```

Usage in templates:
```html
{% show_courses %}
```

## Conclusion

Custom template tags enhance your Django templates with personalized features. By following this guide, you can create custom filters and inclusion tags to tailor your application's presentation layer.


## Conclusion

Proper configuration and management of static and media files are essential for building robust and efficient Django applications. By following the guidelines provided in this documentation, you'll be able to ensure that your static and media files are served correctly and consistently.

For more detailed information, refer to the official [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/static-files/) on static files and [media files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/files/).
